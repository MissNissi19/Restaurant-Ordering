Restaurant Ordering

The "Restaurant Ordering" is a JavaScript-based application designed to facilitate ordering from a restaurant's menu. It is a solo project where I implemented the design provided in Figma. The platform aims to streamline the ordering process for customers by providing a user-friendly interface to explore and select from various menu options available.
You will need a web server to run this to go around CORS limitations.
